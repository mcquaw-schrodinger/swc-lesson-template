This lesson was developed using a slimmed-down variant of the “Understanding by Design” process. The main sections are:

1. Assumptions about audience, time, etc. (The current draft also includes some conclusions and decisions in this section - that should be refactored.)
1. Desired results: overall goals, summative assessments at half-day granularity, what learners will be able to do, what learners will know.
1. Learning plan: each episode has a heading that summarizes what will be covered, then estimates time that will be spent on teaching and on exercises, while the exercises are given as bullet points.

# Stage 1: Assumptions
## Audience
* Users of Schrodinger Python Utilities
* Who are familiar with interactive Python
* But have *not* used Jupyter Notebooks

## Constraints
* 90 minutes
* Native installs on user machines
* No dependence on other Carpentry modules
* Use Jupyter Notebook
* Use Schrodinger Python

## Useful Example

## Data

## Focus

## Challenges

# Stage 2: Desired Results
## Questions
### How do I...

## Skills
### I can...

## Conceptes
### I know...

# Stage 3: Learning Plan
